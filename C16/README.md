The code we have provided uses K-Means to cluster the homeworks according to their similarity and plots them to a graph. To  use the program you have to unzip the homework file to the same directory where the project python file is so it can search the directory and find the correct folders name K(x)(y). The program then reads the directory finds the final sumbission, removes comments and empty lines. After cleaning the data it then starts finding similarties by homework tasks, firstly task 1 then task 2 and so on. It then starts finding the similarities for lexical and abstract syntax trees. We use cosine similarity which measures the similarity between two vectors of an inner product space. It is measured by the cosine of the angle between two vectors and determines whether two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction. We make the source code into vectors so we could use the cosine similarity. Then the code finds the abstract syntax tree(AST) similarity by converting the AST object into a string representation of the code and then compares the string representation of the AST for the two files. It then clusters the programs according to their similarity scores and plots them to the graph.
